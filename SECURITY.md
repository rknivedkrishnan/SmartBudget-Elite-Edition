## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our users' data seriously. Although SmartBudget is a client-side only application and does not store data on any server, we still encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities found in the code.

To report a vulnerability, please:
1. Open a GitHub Issue with the prefix `[SECURITY]`.
2. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue.

We will acknowledge your report and work to address the vulnerability as quickly as possible.
